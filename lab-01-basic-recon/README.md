# Lab 01 – Basic Reconnaissance

## Objective
Perform basic reconnaissance on a target using passive and light active techniques to identify publicly available information and open services.

This lab focuses on understanding the reconnaissance phase, not exploitation.

## Scope
- Educational and authorized testing only
- Public domains or test targets (example.com, scanme.nmap.org)

## Tools Used
- Command line
- Ping
- Nslookup
- Nmap (basic scan)
- Browser (manual inspection)

## Steps Overview
1. Target identification
2. Passive information gathering
3. Basic connectivity check
4. Light port scanning
5. Documentation of findings

## Target
example.com

## Results Summary
- Domain resolves correctly
- Web service available on standard ports
- No sensitive information identified
- Target behaves as expected for a public test domain

## Outcome
This lab demonstrates the ability to:
- Follow a structured reconnaissance process
- Use basic tools correctly
- Document findings clearly
- Respect scope and authorization

## Disclaimer
This lab is for learning purposes only. No unauthorized testing was performed.
